Ben Thompson menulis untuk Stratechery:

>Indeed, this is the most frustrating aspect of this debate: Apple consistently acts like a company peeved it is not getting its fair share, somehow ignoring the fact it is worth nearly $2 trillion precisely because the iPhone matters more than anything. 

Pertarungan di sekitar App Store makin lama makin besar. Akankah berakhir dengan keputusan antitrust bagi Apple.
