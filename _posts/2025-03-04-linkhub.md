## Code:

https://github.com/hanief/LinkHub

## Introduction

**LinkHub** is an open-source project designed to help users create a personalized landing page for their most important links. Whether you're a creator, professional, or community manager, LinkHub provides a simple, elegant way to share all your key destinations—social profiles, blogs, products, and more—in one place.

---

## What is LinkHub?

**LinkHub** is a “Simple links website”. Its main goal is to let users display a collection of links on a single, visually appealing page. The project is public and written primarily in TypeScript. The UI is modern, responsive, and customizable, making it perfect for sharing on social media or as a digital business card.

**Example use cases:**

- Creators sharing social media, YouTube, and blog links
- Businesses aggregating product, contact, and portfolio links
- Communities offering quick access to resources and channels

---

## Technologies Used

LinkHub is built using a modern web stack, including:

- **TypeScript:** Used across the client, server, and shared schema files for static typing and reliability.
- **React:** Powers the frontend interface and dynamic components.
- **Express.js:** Serves the backend API (`server/index.ts`), handling requests and managing link/profile data.
- **Radix UI & Lucide React:** For accessible, customizable UI primitives (dialogs, menubars, icons).
- **Vite:** Development and bundling tool for fast builds and hot reloading.
- **React Icons:** Provides scalable social and web icons for links.
- **Tailwind CSS (style classes):** Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development.

## Code Structure Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

- `client/` – Frontend code (React, UI components, pages)
- `server/` – Backend/Express API and server logic
- `shared/` – Schema definitions shared between client and server

### Key Files & Components

#### 1. Frontend

- **`client/index.html`**: Entry HTML file, loads fonts and scripts, sets up the root React mounting point.

- **`client/src/pages/home.tsx`**: Main landing page. Loads profile info and an array of links—each with a title, URL, icon, and priority.

- **`client/src/components/ui/link-card.tsx`**: Renders each link as a card with icon, title, and URL. Uses React Icons for social/media branding.

  ```tsx
  export function LinkCard({ title, url, icon, isPrimary = false }: LinkCardProps) {
    return (
      <a href={url} ...>
        <div>{getIconComponent(icon)}</div>
        <span>{title}</span>
      </a>
    );
  }
  ```

- **UI Components**: Includes sidebar, pagination, dialog, menubar, navigation menu, and context menu, all built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind utility classes for a polished look.

#### 2. Backend

- **`server/index.ts`**: Sets up Express.js server, registers API routes, and serves static assets via Vite.

- **`server/routes.ts`**: Defines API endpoints like `/api/profile` and `/api/links`; returns static or stored user profile and links data.

  ```typescript
  app.get("/api/profile", (req, res) => {
    res.json(profileData)
  })
  app.get("/api/links", (req, res) => {
    res.json(linksData)
  })
  ```

- **`server/storage.ts`**: (In-memory) storage for user data, providing CRUD operations for users.

#### 3. Shared Schema

- **`shared/schema.ts`**: TypeScript definitions for profile and link data.
  ```typescript
  export const links = pgTable("links", { ... });
  export type Link = typeof links.$inferSelect;
  ```

## How Users Interact with LinkHub

1. **Landing Page**: Users visit the LinkHub page and see the owner’s profile (name, avatar, bio) along with a list of clickable cards for each link.
2. **Cards**: Each card is styled, features an appropriate icon, and links out to social media, products, portfolios, or other destinations.
3. **Sidebar & Navigation**: Advanced UI components for navigation and additional actions, providing a seamless user experience.
4. **API**: The backend APIs (`/api/profile`, `/api/links`) supply profile and link data, which the frontend fetches and displays.

## Example: Adding a Link

To add a new link, you would update the links array in the backend or in the static data for development. Each link includes:

- `title`: Display name
- `url`: Destination URL
- `icon`: Icon identifier (e.g., "fa-twitter")
- `isPrimary`: Marks the link as highlighted
