In the equilibrium of time

you never fail to embrace

let stars shine

give moon the stage it need

listen to silence of world

where you can hear sound deep inside

smell the trail of adventurer

on the soil, above the water, in the air

in the darkest part of the night

you will see a path of light

bow, cry, praise, pray

in this black, tranquil, serene time and space.
