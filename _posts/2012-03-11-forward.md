Okay, maybe this science concept as a metaphor of life is a little bit lame and misleading. But, I’ll use it nevertheless.

According to the Wikipedia entry, Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion or rest, or the tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion. Inertia comes from the Latin word, iners, meaning idle, or lazy. Isaac Newton defined inertia as his first law in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which states: “The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line”.

Metaphorically, the choice of life is easy: stand still or get moving. The later will get you somewhere, probably to an unknown territory, but the former will get you nowhere with increasing burden of force to get moving over time.

Choose wise and bold.
