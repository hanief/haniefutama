This is one of my favorite hadith, explaining beautifully about His relationship with His beloved creature. 

Allah Almighty said: 
â€œMy servant draws near to Me with nothing more loved by Me than the acts of worship that I have enjoined upon him. My servant continues to try to draw near to Me with more devotion, until I love him. When I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his sight by which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, his feet on which he walks. When he asks Me for something, I will respond and when he takes refuge in Me, I will grant it to him". (Al Bukhari) 

Truly mesmerizing concept. :)
