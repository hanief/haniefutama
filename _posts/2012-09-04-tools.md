One of life's biggest mess up is about how to differ between achievement and means to achieve it.

In my previous days, I have fallen to this trap, a lot. Some because of my youth foolness, some because of the subtlety of the difference between them. One of those trap is on gadgetry. 

I can spend hours, playing those gadget. Be it a laptop, blackberrys, iphones, ipads, or just about anything. I can completely forgotten of time playing with those. Whether it is working, playing games, watching movies, browsing, or just toying with it. 

I guess this comes from my early childhood routines of unassemblying my toys completely so I can observe how it works. But, of course I can't put it back to be working again. This habit of toying with gadget is dangerous because it can eat your productivity. 

You feel exhausted at the end of the day, yet nothing seems accomplished. After much contemplating into it, I come to conclusion that this bad habit comes from inability to differ the means (which is the gadget) and the goals (which is getting things done). Those gadget should be used only if it supporting me in achieving the goals, not the other way around. 

You should not overwhelmed or even enslaved by your gadget. Use it only as tool. A mere means.
