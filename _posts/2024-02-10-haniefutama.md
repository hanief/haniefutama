## Code:

https://github.com/hanief/haniefutama

## Introduction

It is a public personal blog project. Designed primarily as a static site, it leverages modern web technologies and showcases a clean structure ideal for personal blogging.

## Technology Stack

The codebase mainly employs front-end web technologies, along with a touch of backend scripting:

- **HTML:** The backbone of the repository, used to structure the blog's pages and content.
- **CSS & SCSS:** For styling and layout, enabling responsive and visually appealing blog posts. SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor that brings variables, nesting, and more advanced features to CSS, making styles easier to manage.
- **Ruby:** Likely used for static site generation or scripting tasks (possibly Jekyll, a common blog generator for GitHub Pages, though not explicitly mentioned). Ruby scripts can help manage blog posts, automate publishing, or customize build processes.
- **Shell:** Minimal shell scripting, probably for deployment, build automation, or local development tasks.

## Features and Workflow

- **Static Blog:** The project is designed as a static blog, which means all content is pre-rendered and served as-is, resulting in fast load times and minimal hosting requirements.
- **Customization:** The use of SCSS allows for easy customization of themes and layouts, making the blog visually distinct and easy to manage.
- **Automation:** Ruby and shell scripts likely automate repetitive tasks, such as generating new posts, building the site, or deploying updates.
- **Open Source:** As a public repository, others can clone, fork, and learn from the project, making it a useful reference for budding web developers.

## Why Use This Approach?

- **Simplicity and Speed:** Static blogs are fast, secure, and easy to host, especially on platforms like GitHub Pages.
- **Maintainability:** Separating structure (HTML), style (CSS/SCSS), and automation (Ruby/Shell) ensures the codebase remains clean and maintainable.
- **Learning Opportunity:** Mixing multiple technologies in a personal project is an excellent way for developers to learn and showcase their skills.
