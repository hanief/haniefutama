Salaam. Hello again. I'm blogging again. Accompanied by snow shower from the "Beast from the East", reaching you all over the world. This past year has been an interesting and full of new experience. I would like to share with you a snippet of those.

For those who don't know yet, I've been living in Nottingham, UK for the past year. My wife is pursuing a Ph.D program in Bioscience at [University of Nottingham](nottingham.ac.uk).
