I"Á<p>Iâ€™ve had multiple blog since the beginning of my introduction to Internet. I have accounts on Blogger, Wordpress, and Tumblr. Yet, here I am writing the very first blog entry on my new personal blog.</p>

<p>I have this domain for a long time. I consider it a nice domain for my personal blog. It has my full name on it with possibilities for another subdomains when there are another cahya utama family that want to blog.</p>

<p>I intend to write regularly in English and Indonesian here. I am working on practicing my English and this is one of my tools for it. I hope I can consistently wrote two entries for each week.</p>

<p>This is exciting times for blogging. Hope you agree with me. :)</p>
